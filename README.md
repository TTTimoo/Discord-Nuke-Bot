# Discord-Nuke-Bot
A Discord Nuke Bot made in python (Look README.md) 

(1) First install it as a zip file

(2) then unzip it

(3) then open the .bat file. (its installing colorama or other things, if you still don't trust me then just edit the .bat file with notepad++) 

(4) then run the .exe file. (its a .exe file because if it wasn't people will steal my sourche code and claim it as their own

(5) it will look like this (screenshot)
